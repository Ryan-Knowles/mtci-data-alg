    "## Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Start with unsorted array\n",
    "2. Compare adjacent elements from start of array\n",
    "3. If left element is greater than right element, swap them\n",
    "4. Move to next pair of adjacent elements\n",
    "5. After reaching end of array, largest element will be in correct position\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 2-5 for remaining unsorted portion\n",
    "7. Continue until no more swaps needed (array is sorted)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Teaching sorting concepts (simple to understand)\n",
    "- Working with very small datasets\n",
    "- Array is already nearly sorted\n",
    "- Memory is extremely limited (in-place with O(1) space)\n",
    "- Simplicity is more important than efficiency\n",
    "- Need a stable sort and simplicity is preferred\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selection Sort \n",
    "\n",
    "Divides input into sorted and unsorted regions, repeatedly selects smallest element from unsorted region and adds it to sorted region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Start with unsorted array\n",
    "2. Find minimum element in unsorted portion\n",
    "3. Swap minimum element with first element of unsorted portion\n",
    "4. Move boundary between sorted and unsorted portions one element ahead\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2-4 until entire array is sorted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Minimizing the number of swaps is critical (performs exactly n-1 swaps)\n",
    "- Working with small datasets\n",
    "- Memory writes are expensive but comparisons are cheap\n",
    "- Teaching sorting concepts (conceptually simple)\n",
    "- Consistency in performance is more important than speed\n",
    "- Simplicity of implementation is a priority\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Builds final sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly inserting a new element into the sorted portion of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Start with first element considered as sorted portion\n",
    "2. Take next element from unsorted portion\n",
    "3. Compare with each element in sorted portion from right to left\n",
    "4. If sorted element is greater, shift it one position right\n",
    "5. Insert current element in correct position\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 2-5 until all elements are sorted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",

    "## Merge Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide and conquer algorithm that recursively splits array in half, sorts, and merges back together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Divide array into two halves recursively until each subarray has 1 element\n",
    "2. Compare elements in pairs and merge subarrays in sorted order\n",
    "3. Continue merging sorted subarrays until entire array is merged\n",
    "4. When merging:\n",
    "   - Create temporary array to store merged result\n",
    "   - Compare elements from both subarrays\n",
    "   - Add smaller element to temporary array\n",
    "   - Move pointer of subarray that contained smaller element\n",

    "## Quick Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Also uses divide and conquer, picks a 'pivot' element and partitions other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Choose a pivot element from the array\n",
    "2. Partition array around pivot - elements less than pivot go to left, greater go to right\n",
    "3. Recursively apply steps 1-2 to subarrays on left and right of pivot\n",
    "4. Base case is when subarray has 1 or 0 elements\n",
    "5. When partitioning:\n",
    "   - Take rightmost element as pivot\n",
    "   - Keep track of elements smaller than pivot\n",
    "   - Traverse array and swap elements smaller than pivot to left side\n",
    "   - Place pivot in final position between left and right partitions\n",
    "   - Return pivot position\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Average-case performance is more important than worst-case\n",
    "- Working with random data (performs very well)\n",
    "- Memory usage needs to be minimized (in-place with O(log n) stack space)\n",

    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Build max heap from input array\n",
    "2. Swap root (maximum element) with last element of heap\n",
    "3. Reduce heap size by 1 to exclude sorted element\n",
    "4. Heapify root node to maintain max heap property\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2-4 until heap size is 1\n",
    "6. When heapifying:\n",
    "   - Compare root with left and right children\n",
    "   - Find largest among root and children\n",
    "   - If root is not largest, swap with largest child\n",
    "   - Recursively heapify affected subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use when:**\n",
    "- Guaranteed worst-case performance is required (always O(n log n))\n",
    "- Memory usage must be minimized (in-place with O(1) extra space)\n",

    "## Test Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "For each question select the best sorting algorithm and explain why\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 - Sort 10 schools around your house by distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection array would work due to small size of input. Insertion sort, or any other sort would work as well due to the small input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Insertion Sort because it's a small input size, and in these cases this algorithm is very effective, plus if the input is (or almost) sorted it will be even faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 - eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount:\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort if we can't fit all the data into memory, or Quick sort if worst case is not a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Radix or Counting Sort because it's a number within a range, so we can take advantage of their fast execution with numbers, plus it's an integer value, and since it's on eBay it won't be a value like a billion, they'll be smaller values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 - Sport scores on ESPN:\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort if we can't fit all the data into memory, or Quick sort if worst case is not a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Quick Sort because sometimes they have decimals, different formats for football, tennis, etc. It will be the most efficient, because despite worrying about the worst case because the inputs can be different, it's important to worry about the memory space we'll occupy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4 - Massive database (can't fit all into memory) needs to sort through past year's user data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort because we can't fit all the data into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Merge Sort because we won't be sorting in memory since the data is very large, and because the size is massive we should prioritize time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5 - Almost sorted Udemy review data needs to update and add 2 new reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion sort because the data is almost sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Insertion Sort because the information is almost sorted, and we're only adding 2 reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6 - Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada:\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort if we can't fit all the data into memory, or Quick sort if worst case is not a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Radix or Counting Sort because they don't have decimals, and are usually 2-digit numbers, which will allow us to take advantage of resources using these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7 - Large user name database needs to be sorted. Data is very random:\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort if we can't fit all the data into memory, or Quick sort if worst case is not a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Merge Sort if we have enough memory, or Quick Sort if we're not worried about the worst case and can select a good pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8 - You want to teach sorting for the first time:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble or selection sort because they are simple and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  Bubble Sort, Selection Sort because they are the simplest."
