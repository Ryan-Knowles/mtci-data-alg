    "# Red Black Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Red Black Trees are self-balancing binary search trees that maintain balance through a set of properties and color-based constraints. They were invented by Rudolf Bayer in 1972 (originally called \"symmetric binary B-trees\") and later named \"Red-Black\" trees by Leo J. Guibas and Robert Sedgewick in 1978.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "A Red Black Tree follows these key properties:\n",
    "1. Every node is either red or black\n",
    "2. The root node is always black\n",
    "3. All leaves (NIL/NULL nodes) are black\n",
    "4. If a node is red, both its children must be black (no two adjacent red nodes)\n",
    "5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes (this is called the \"black height\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Red Black Trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Red Black Trees guarantee that no path from the root to a leaf is more than twice as long as any other path. This ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, which provides:\n",
    "- O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations\n",
    "- Efficient rebalancing after insertions and deletions\n",
    "- Predictable performance for real-time applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "When inserting a new node:\n",
    "- The node is initially colored red\n",
    "- Standard BST insertion is performed\n",
    "- If any Red Black Tree properties are violated, rebalancing is done through:\n",
    "  - Recoloring: Changing the colors of nodes\n",
    "  - Rotations: Left and right rotations to restructure the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "Deletion is more complex, involving:\n",
    "1. Standard BST deletion\n",
    "2. If the removed node or its replacement causes violations of Red Black properties\n",
    "3. Rebalancing through rotations and recoloring\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rebalancing Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Red Black Trees use two primary operations for rebalancing:\n",
    "1. Color flips: Changing the color of nodes\n",
    "2. Rotations:\n",
    "  - Left rotation: Pivoting around a node to shift the structure left\n",
    "  - Right rotation: Pivoting around a node to shift the structure right\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search: O(log n)\n",
    "- Insert: O(log n)\n",
    "- Delete: O(log n)\n",
    "- Space: O(n)   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages and Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used in many language standard libraries (C++ STL, Java TreeMap/TreeSet)\n",
    "- Database indexing structures\n",
    "- Computational geometry algorithms\n",
    "- Linux kernel uses Red Black Trees for process scheduling\n",
    "- Used in implementing certain map and set data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compared to Other Self-Balancing Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "- Red Black Trees require less rotations than AVL trees for insertion and deletion\n",
    "- While AVL trees are more strictly balanced, Red Black Trees offer better insertion and deletion performance\n",
    "- Red Black Trees are essentially a type of 2-3-4 tree represented as a binary tree\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Red Black Trees offer a good balance between complexity of implementation and performance, making them popular in many practical applications where balanced search trees are needed."
