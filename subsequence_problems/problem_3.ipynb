    "# Problem 3: Count Subsequences in Lexicographical Range (Medium)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string s and two strings lower and upper, count the number of subsequences of s that are lexicographically between lower and upper (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"abcde\", lower = \"bb\", upper = \"cd\"\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: The subsequences [\"bc\", \"bd\", \"cd\"] are all lexicographically in the range [\"bb\", \"cd\"].\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"xyz\", lower = \"a\", upper = \"z\"\n",
    "Output: 7\n",
    "Explanation: All non-empty subsequences of \"xyz\" are in the range.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- 1 <= s.length <= 100\n",
    "- 1 <= lower.length, upper.length <= 100\n",
    "- lower is lexicographically smaller than or equal to upper.\n",
    "- All strings consist of lowercase English letters."
